> **Important**: I'm current working in a new version of this software, trying to reach better programming pratices and architecture methods. Stay tunned!

DLDelivery, Drogaria Litor√¢nea Delivery, ou DLD is an auxiliar delivery system to our drugstore. In my city the addresses in Google Maps are not correct, some time there are only a map but without any other information. The city hall also doens't provide a detailed city map, and a lot of streets doesn't even have a name. So basically this system is a database for manipulate GPS coordinates.

## v1.0-rc
This is a release candidate version, there are some bugs to fix and features do add, but is already useable.
